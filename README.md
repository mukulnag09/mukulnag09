I have always been an enthusiastic learner and my deep love for computer technologies has driven me to explore various aspects and avenues related to it.
I have worked on google cloud through hands-on labs and have a good understanding of Linux-based systems.
I have worked on python for automation and projects.
Learning DSA using C++ and basics of Web Technology. 
other facets that I have explored are IT administration and networking, game development using C++ and unreal engine, and Cyber security using Kali Linux.
As a hobby I have been learning music theory and music production using FL studio. I have completed learned and completed many courses on required subjects.
